# Asia_costs_summary
Hi, in this year me and my friend, we have been bacppacking through south east asia for a 4 monts. There were ups and downs but in general we didn’t want to come back yet. Only thing which made us came back was…money. 
Its not like we didn’t expect that , in Poland we are broke students. We calculated that in order to stay in Asia for 4 months, we would have to spend 54 PLN (12 EUR) per day.
I made this sum up of our costs and I would like to share it with u (maybe it will be useful to you if you also plan to fly to that part of the world).
