# Asia_costs_summary
Hi, I was backpacking around Southeast Asia for 4 months this year with my best friend. There were ups and downs but in general we didn’t want to come back yet. Only thing which made us came back was…money. 
It's not like we didn’t expect that, in Poland we are broke students. We calculated that in order to stay in Asia for 4 months, we would have to spend 54 PLN (12 EUR) per day.
I made this sum up of our costs and I would like to share it with u (maybe it will be useful to you if you also plan to fly to that part of the world).
Cheers
